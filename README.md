# Homework2
week one homework 2
* this code is an about me page with a focus on learning bootstrap and building a page with a navbar. In that navbar there is a contact link, a portfolio link, which will be used later for actual content. 
*you can click on the navbar links and they will take you to other pages in the site, which give other info. 
*i downloaded lots of premade bootstrap codes off of the bootstrap website as well as mdbootstrap.com to help fill out my code and get a great layout. 
*as well as bootsnip.com 
*There will be much more to add to this page whenever we get other things added to our portfolios.
